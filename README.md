# Boogian
Best discord self bot (For fun) :D

**IF YOU ARE GONNA USE THIS PLEASE READ "HOW TO USE" AND DONT TRY TO GET HELP FROM ME!!!!!

# How to setup

This uses discord.py-self as well as many more python libs so your gonna need [python](https://www.python.org/) as well as [ollama](ollama.ai) and download llama3 (for the ai)

2nd were going to clone this using this command in terminal (YOU NEED GIT)

`git clone https://github.com/Stabbyiscool/Boogian.git`

And were gonna wanna download the json template from [here](https://file.io/fUFfquXzqonb) and configure it with all of the things u need.

3rd we are gonna be installing all of the libs from 'requirements.txt'. This is important cause it is required for the bot to even run. U can do this by `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

Once all of that is finished u can run the main.py and it SHOULD work fine. U can report issues [here](https://github.com/Stabbyiscool/Boogian/issues)
